Vivado Simulator 2019.2
Time resolution is 1 ps


First, test by trying all 268 (256 Dx.y and 12 Kx.y)
valid inputs, with both + and - starting disparity.
We check that the encoder output and ending disparity is correct.
We also check that the decoder matches.
          0 errors in that testing.

Now lets test all (legal and illegal) codes into the decoder.
checking all possible decode inputs

Done testing decoder.

Total error count:           0
Congratulations!
