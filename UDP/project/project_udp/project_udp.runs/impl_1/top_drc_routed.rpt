CFGBVS-1#1 Warning
Missing CFGBVS and CONFIG_VOLTAGE Design Properties  
Neither the CFGBVS nor CONFIG_VOLTAGE voltage property is set in the current_design.  Configuration bank voltage select (CFGBVS) must be set to VCCO or GND, and CONFIG_VOLTAGE must be set to the correct configuration voltage, in order to determine the I/O voltage support for the pins in bank 0.  It is suggested to specify these either using the 'Edit Device Properties' function in the GUI or directly in the XDC file using the following syntax:

 set_property CFGBVS value1 [current_design]
 #where value1 is either VCCO or GND

 set_property CONFIG_VOLTAGE value2 [current_design]
 #where value2 is the voltage provided to configuration bank 0

Refer to the device configuration user guide for more information.

PDCN-1569#1 Warning
LUT equation term check  
Used physical LUT pin 'A1' of cell udp_top_inst/udp_tx_inst/cnt_byte_depth[0]_i_3 (pin udp_top_inst/udp_tx_inst/cnt_byte_depth[0]_i_3/I3) is not included in the LUT equation: 'O6=(A3*(~A2)*A4*(~A6))+(A3*(~A2)*(~A4)*(~A5)*(~A6))'. If this cell is a user instantiated LUT in the design, please remove connectivity to the pin or change the equation and/or INIT string of the LUT to prevent this issue. If the cell is inferred or IP created LUT, please regenerate the IP and/or resynthesize the design to attempt to correct the issue.
Related violations: <none>

PDCN-1569#2 Warning
LUT equation term check  
Used physical LUT pin 'A2' of cell udp_top_inst/udp_tx_inst/cnt_byte_depth[0]_i_4 (pin udp_top_inst/udp_tx_inst/cnt_byte_depth[0]_i_4/I2) is not included in the LUT equation: 'O6=(A6*A1*(~A3))+(A6*(~A1)*(~A3)*A4)+((~A6)*A5*A1*(~A3))+((~A6)*A5*(~A1)*(~A3)*A4)+((~A6)*(~A5)*(~A3)*A4)'. If this cell is a user instantiated LUT in the design, please remove connectivity to the pin or change the equation and/or INIT string of the LUT to prevent this issue. If the cell is inferred or IP created LUT, please regenerate the IP and/or resynthesize the design to attempt to correct the issue.
Related violations: <none>

PDCN-1569#3 Warning
LUT equation term check  
Used physical LUT pin 'A4' of cell udp_top_inst/udp_rx_inst/cnt_byte[9]_i_14 (pin udp_top_inst/udp_rx_inst/cnt_byte[9]_i_14/I3) is not included in the LUT equation: 'O6=((~A1)*A6*A3*(~A2))+((~A1)*(~A6)*A3*(~A2)*A5)'. If this cell is a user instantiated LUT in the design, please remove connectivity to the pin or change the equation and/or INIT string of the LUT to prevent this issue. If the cell is inferred or IP created LUT, please regenerate the IP and/or resynthesize the design to attempt to correct the issue.
Related violations: <none>

PDCN-1569#4 Warning
LUT equation term check  
Used physical LUT pin 'A4' of cell udp_top_inst/udp_tx_inst/cnt_byte_depth[0]_i_2 (pin udp_top_inst/udp_tx_inst/cnt_byte_depth[0]_i_2/I1) is not included in the LUT equation: 'O6=(A6*A2*A3*A1)+(A6*A2*(~A3))+(A6*(~A2)*A5*A3*A1)+(A6*(~A2)*A5*(~A3))+(A6*(~A2)*(~A5)*A3*A1)+((~A6)*A5*A3*A1)+((~A6)*A5*(~A3))+((~A6)*(~A5)*A3*A1)'. If this cell is a user instantiated LUT in the design, please remove connectivity to the pin or change the equation and/or INIT string of the LUT to prevent this issue. If the cell is inferred or IP created LUT, please regenerate the IP and/or resynthesize the design to attempt to correct the issue.
